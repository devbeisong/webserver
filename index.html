    <h3>Life Planner: Your AI-Powered Life Companion</h3>
    <p><strong>More than a to-do list—it's your personal productivity partner.</strong></p>
    <p>Life Planner transforms traditional task management by creating an ongoing conversation with you about your life. Instead of static lists you forget to check, our AI actively engages with you throughout the day, learning your patterns and adapting to your reality.</p>

    <p><b>How it works:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proactive check-ins that feel natural, not intrusive</li>
        <li>Intelligent assistance when you're stuck or procrastinating</li>
        <li>Real-time plan adjustments as life happens</li>
        <li>Celebrates your wins and helps you learn from setbacks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <b>The difference:</b> While other apps wait for you to update them, Life Planner comes to you. It understands that life is messy, priorities shift, and sometimes you need encouragement more than another reminder.
        <br>
        Perfect for busy professionals, students, and anyone who wants to stay organized without feeling overwhelmed by their own productivity system. Life Planner doesn't just track what you do—it helps you become who you want to be.
        <br>
        <i>Finally, a planner that gets it.</i>
